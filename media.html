    <h3>Our Target Goals</h3>
    <section id="video1">
        <h4>Reduce oil pollution</h4>

        <h4>Reduce oil pollution</h4>
        <p>Oil pollution is a significant threat to marine ecosystems, affecting water quality, harming marine life, and disrupting coastal communities. It can result from oil spills, leaks from ships and offshore platforms, and runoff from land-based sources. Addressing oil pollution requires a combination of prevention, rapid response, and long-term remediation efforts to protect and restore affected environments.</p>

        <div class="video-overlay">
        <h4>Testing and Quality Assurance</h4>
        <p>Testing and quality assurance are critical components of the development process for any technology, including renewable energy systems. Rigorous testing ensures that these systems operate efficiently, safely, and reliably. Quality assurance processes help identify and mitigate potential issues before they become significant problems, ultimately leading to better performance and increased public trust in renewable energy technologies.</p>

        <h4>Renewable Energy Production</h4>
        <p>Renewable energy production involves harnessing natural processes to generate energy in a sustainable manner. This includes technologies such as solar panels, wind turbines, and wave energy converters. By investing in renewable energy production, we can reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, decrease greenhouse gas emissions, and promote a cleaner, healthier planet.</p>
