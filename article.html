            <h2>Wave Energy Conversion</h2>
            <p>Wave energy conversion is a process that captures the energy of ocean waves and converts it into usable forms of energy, typically electricity. This renewable energy source has gained attention due to its potential to provide a consistent and reliable power supply.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>How Wave Energy Conversion Works</h2>
            <p>Wave energy conversion systems typically consist of devices that float on the surface of the ocean or are anchored to the seabed. These devices move with the motion of the waves, and this movement is harnessed to generate electricity. Common types of wave energy converters include point absorbers, oscillating water columns, and attenuators.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Benefits of Wave Energy Conversion</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Renewable and Sustainable: Wave energy is a renewable resource that can provide a continuous supply of energy.</li>
                <li>Low Environmental Impact: Wave energy conversion has a minimal environmental footprint compared to fossil fuels.</li>
                <li>High Energy Density: Ocean waves have a high energy density, making them an efficient source of power.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Challenges and Future Prospects</h3>
            <p>Despite its potential, wave energy conversion faces several challenges, including high initial costs, technological complexity, and environmental concerns related to marine ecosystems. However, ongoing research and development are focused on overcoming these challenges and improving the efficiency and viability of wave energy conversion systems.</p>
